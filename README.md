# File-Arranger
This is a script that is meant to be ran in the background. It detects newly created files in the downloads directory then sorts them by file extension.
Example : *.mp3,*.wav,*.ogg  will be detected and moved into ~/Music. Spreadsheets file types will be moved into ~/Documents/Spreadsheets. 
Basically it does this for a variety of file formats.

This project was a small personal project that i wanted to start because i am lazy. 
I thought automation would be the right way to go so i dont have to spend so much time organizing files.
The first AutoShell.sh was completely written by me but as you can tell i did a really bad job i was lucky enough to meet
a nice man on a facebook linux group where he gave advice and even rewrote the entire script.

FIXES : The issue with file corruption has been fixed in the 3.0 version. 
It waits until the file is done downloading then moves it which is wonderful once again thanks to the co-Author
which im not gonna lie did a majority of the work.

-Thanks
