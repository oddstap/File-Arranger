# File-Arranger
This is a script that is meant to be ran in the background. It detects newly created files in the downloads directory then sorts them by file extension.
Example : *.mp3,*.wav,*.ogg  will be detected and moved into ~/Music. Spreadsheets file types will be moved into ~/Documents/Spreadsheets. 
Basically it does this for a variety of file formats.

This project was a small personal project that i wanted to start because i am lazy. 
I thought automation would be the right way to go so i dont have to spend so much time organizing files.
The first AutoShell.sh was completely written by me but as you can tell i did a really bad job i was lucky enough to meet
a nice man on a facebook linux group where he gave advice and even rewrote the entire script this is AutoShell_2.0.sh
much cleaner right?

ISSUE : The only issue i have so far is that when downloading a file the script will move the file while its downloading resulting in corruption.
So if you can come up with a fix thank you but i also will take any ideas to make it better in general. 

-Thanks
